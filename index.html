      <h1>Protein </h1>
      <img src="meat.jpg" alt = "white cup of Protein" style="float: left;">
   <p>Proteins are made up of chemical 'building blocks' called amino acids. Your body uses amino acids to build and repair muscles and bones and to make hormones and enzymes. They can also be used as an energy source.<p>

          <h2>Fiber </h2>
          <img src="weet.jpg" alt = "white cup of Protein" style="float: left;"> 
          
             <p> Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot digest. Eating a fiber-rich diet may reduce your risk for heart disease and diabetes, lower your cholesterol levels, and help you lose weight by increasing satiety. Aim to eat at least 20-35 grams of fiber each day.<p>

                <h3>Calcium </h3>
                <img src="calcium.jpg" alt = "white cup of Protein" style="float: left;">
                
             <p>Calcium is the fifth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust (4.1%). It is not found uncombined in nature, but occurs abundantly as limestone (calcium carbonate), gypsum (calcium sulfate), fluorite (calcium fluoride) and apatite (calcium chloro- or fluoro-phosphate). Hard water contains dissolved calcium bicarbonate.<p>

                <h4>Dairy </h4>
              <img src="milk.jpg" alt = "white cup of Protein" style="float: left;">  
              
              <br> <p>Wisconsin ranks #2 in milk production, generating 2.4 billion pounds of milk every month.
                  The average dairy cow produces 6.3 gallons of milk per day and about 350,000 glasses of milk in a lifetime.
                  Milk's white color is due to its fat content. Eating or drinking dairy products offers health benefits, like building and maintaining strong bones. Dairy Group foods provide nutrients that are vital for the health and maintenance of the body. These nutrients include calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein.
                  The average American consumes 25 gallons of milk a year. <p>
